making data produced by eye-tracking device more accessible to the people working with it. will be written in python. more details to follow.


INSTALL
=======

Windows:
-------

1.) install Python 2.7
2.) install python package Numpy
3.) install python package wxPython
4.) install python package OpenCV
 - download opencv superpack
 - copy cv.pyd and cv2.pyd
   into your python site-packages directory (e.g. C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages)
 - copy opencv dlls (opencv_*.dll) of the superpack
   to your python executable (e.g. C:\Python27)
   be sure to copy the right dlls (x64 or x86) and don't forget the opencv_ffmpeg.dll which may be in another place than the other dlls
 - the location the specified files changes between opencv releases, so you have to find them on your own

Linux:
------

Same procedure as in windows but using your package manager will make things easy.

Ubuntu (should be the same in other Debian flavored distros):
  sudo apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8 python-opencv

BUILD DISTRIBUTION
==================

prerequire: 
 - python package py2exe installed
 - MSVCP90.dll available (e.g. lies next to python.exe)

change into src directory and execute

  python setup.py py2exe

  maybe you have to use 'c:\Python27\python.exe' instead of just 'python'
  or maybe you can omit the 'python' part

a dist directory exists after the programm has terminated
copy the cursors directory, the icon.ico file and all the opencv_*.dlls next to the created start_pypsy.exe into the dist directory
you can now distrubute the dist directory and start the application by executing FixCat.exe
